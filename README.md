# Advent of Code
My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

* 2020 Pyton
* 2021 C# ... I took a C# course at school. I didn't finish AoC, I did homework for that course instead. O:)
* 2022 Julia ... Ehm, I was pregnant and sleep was a priority.
* 2023 Python ... No, I won't wake up at 6 A.M. anymore. I have a little baby, so let's see how it will go. But I need to try, otherwise I will forget how to code enitrely.
